# Obsidian Templater Table of Contents Script

This is a script that was taken from the following github discussion: [Table of Contents (Headers) · SilentVoid13/Templater · Discussion #888 · GitHub](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/discussions/888#discussioncomment-7204381)
When set up, you can put this template into your note and it will automatically create a table of contents at the top of your note from the various headings that are in said note.

This script, as the name might imply, requires the Templater Obsidian Plugin, which you can get from here: [GitHub - SilentVoid13/Templater: A template plugin for obsidian](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)

This script must be set up in the following manner in order to work with Templater:

```markdown
<%*
contents of table-of-contents.js
%>
```

After that you can set a keybind to insert this template into your note, or just insert it manually, and the script will do it's magic.
