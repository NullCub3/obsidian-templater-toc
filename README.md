# Obsidian Table of Contents Templater Script

Most of this is not my work, this is a script that was taken from the following discussion: [Table of Contents (Headers) Â· SilentVoid13/Templater Â· Discussion #888 Â· GitHub](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/discussions/888#discussioncomment-7204381)

I created this repo to save and keep track of my changes to the script. Huge thank you to danteali and cr0Kz for working on this script so much, I am eternally grateful. The latest script from them is the initial commit for this repository.

When set up, you can put this template into your note and it will automatically create a table of contents at the top of your note from the various headings that are in said note. As the name might imply, this script requires the Templater Obsidian Plugin, which you can get from here: [GitHub - SilentVoid13/Templater: A template plugin for obsidian](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)


## Instructions

0. Have Templater installed and set up.
1. Create a "scripts" folder somewhere in your vault. (I recommend in your templates folder)
2. Set `Templater Settings > User Script Functions > Script files folder location` to the newly created folder.
3. Copy `Scripts/table_of_contents.js` from this repo into your scripts folder.
4. Copy `Table of Contents.md` from this repo into your templates folder.
5. Optional: Set a "Template Hotkey" for the `Table of Contents.md` template.
6. Adjust the settings in `Table of Contents.md` to your liking.

Once you insert the template into your note (or optionally use the hotkey you just configured) a table of contents will be generated at the top of your note, or according to how you have configured it.


## Modifications to the Script

- Added an option to use a regular heading for the table of contents instead of callout
- Added an option to have a minimum header size to be added to the table of contents, useful if you exclusively use H1 as the note title like I do
- Fixed having wikilinks in headings breaking the links in the table of contents
- Fixed having both the display name and the full link of wikilinks in headings appear in the table of contents (even though that is what Obsidian does by default)
- Moved the links and descriptions of changes from the script itself to this README
- Fixed having markdown links in headings*
- Cleaned up config a bit
- Set up proper URI encoding for markdown-style links
- Configured script to use templater's user script system to allow the file to be split out for easier development and settings adjustment.

\* mostly. There's definitely still some issues but it's not as bad as it used to be.


### Future Plans
- When switching between header/callout styles, have the auto replace work on the old style
- Double check all the options still work together
- Have a github action automatically package the script into a markdown file for use in obsidian and publish a release
- Have more of the options be able to be presented to the user when running the script


## Original Description From Script

> FURTHER UPDATES TO PREVIOUS DANTEALI VERSIONS
> Templater discussion: https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/discussions/888
> After my V2 update (https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/discussions/888#discussioncomment-5523668) cr0Kz merged the two scripts and heavily refactored the code. 
> Cr0Kz latest version (as of 20231005): https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/discussions/888#discussioncomment-7024450
> This version: https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/discussions/888#discussioncomment-7204381
>
> Additional changes in this version:
>  - Added additional code commenting - for my own understanding later when I inevitably come back and forget it all ðŸ˜‰.
>    Not as clean and concise as cr0Kz any longer - sorry!
>  - Added empty line at top of TOC, otherwise there was no separation between file content and TOC callout.
>  - Added debugging (enabled/disabled by constant/switch at top of file) which cr0Kz had in his first version but removed in latest.
>    Added additional debug messages to help me with development. Debug console accessible with Ctrl+Shift+I.
>  - If a TOC already exists it will always be updated in the current location. If no existing TOC, default location is top of file (below
>    any frontmatter). 
>    Added switches to allow default location to be changed to: below the first header, or at cursor position.
>  - Added switch (at top of file) to change from default Markdown-style links used in TOC to Wiki-style links.
>  - Added switch to disable header level depth prompt and const to define default depth. If you know what level you will always want then easy to disable prompt.
